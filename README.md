## Installation
This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install these libraries you will need to execute:
`pip install`

You will need to download Boston & Seattle Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston and https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

## Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree Project. I was interested in using Kaggle AirBnB Data to better understand:
<li> What are the most features correlated to price
<li> How well can we predict weather the review is positive or negative from the review text
<li> Understand how much AirBnB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas
<li> Comparing rates between the two cities
  
## File Description
  <li> <b>Solution_Boston_Prices.ipynb:</b> Jupyter Notebook file contains the data analysis.
  <li> <b>listings.csv:</b> Boston Dataset.
  <li> <b>listings_column_names.csv:</b> Description of each column.
